             I started learning how to play the guitar during my 2nd year of army,
            and I've been practicing ever since. </p>
            
            <p class="para">
            I had little exposure to music theory prior to picking up the guitar (and still have
            a very limited understanding of music theory), so the focus of the blog is not so much
            music theory, but more of the basics of playing a guitar. </p>

            <p class="para">
            In this blog, I will share more about myself and my journey in playing the guitar,
            as well as the basic chords that I started with.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                I will also be sharing some songs that you can play with the chords taught in this blog.
