            <p class="abtpara">I first picked up the guitar 8 years ago. 
               What inspired me then was the abundance of youtube acoustic covers. 
                However, due to a lack in motivation to learn (and the pain of learning 
                an instrument with zero guidance), I gave up on learning the guitar. 10 years ago, resources were
                very limited and the only way to learn was through someone you knew.
             </p>


             <p class="abtpara">Fast forward 4 years later, I was in the army, and I had
                 the money to buy a guitar, as well as the time to learn it again. And so, 
                 I began learning how to play the guitar again. I had friends who played the guitar
                 before and guided me along the way, and after much practice and development of my caluses 
                 on my fingertips, I was able to play the guitar.
              </p>


              <p class="abtpara">At this point in my life, I think I may actually spend some time
                  to learn a little bit of music theory. At my current level, I still have to rely
                  on an app (Ultimate Guitar) to play a song. With music theory however, 
                  you would be able to play a song just by listening to it figuring out the key of the song
                  using the guitar. Hopefully, I will have the time and energy to spend time on that. :')
