            <p class="basicpara">If you are first learning how to play the guitar, and you want to learn
                how to play pop songs, the best way to start is to learn songs in the key of G. Four basic chords 
                should be enough for you to play most songs. Below is a youtube video to learn how to play the four chords.

            <p class="basicpara">1. Click on a song you would like to learn. For this example, I will use the song
                "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran
           </p>
           <img class="basicimg" src="image/ultguitar tabs.jpg" alt="perfecttabs">
            <p class="basicpara">2. Note that for the song perfect, the tabs are already in the key of G (
                since the four chords are G, Em, C, and D).
                
                <p class="basicpara">Also note that the capo is to be placed on the first 
                fret. </p>

                <p class="basicpara"> 3. If need be, you can use the transpose button (-) to transpose the chords until you reach the key of G. To identify
                    if it is in the key of G, just check that there are the chords (G, C, D, Em) Beside the transpose button there will be a number (e.g. -4)
                    That will be the fret you place your capo on!
